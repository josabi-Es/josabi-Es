### Welcome to my Git profile!

üëã Hi, I'm Jose.
After several years working in technical engineering, I discovered the real power of data to transform processes and drive smarter decisions. Since then, my interest in this field has only grown. I'm currently studying a Master‚Äôs in Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Engineering to build a solid foundation as a Data Engineer.
I try to spend most of my time learning about data acquisition, processing, and movement, with a special focus on scalability, cloud environments, and modern system architecture.
